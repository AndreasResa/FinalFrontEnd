          The car showroom is a sleek, modern space designed to showcase a
          variety of vehicles in a polished and professional environment. The
          large, glass-fronted facade allows natural light to flood the
          interior, highlighting the gleaming finishes of the cars on display.
          Inside, the showroom floor is spacious and meticulously clean, with a
          glossy tile or polished concrete surface that reflects the vehicles.
